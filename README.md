# Covid 19 Tracker

This project was created using the React library.

I used [COVID 19 API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc).

## Featuring

* React - UI framework
* React Hook - a way to use state and side-effects in React function components

They can filter out countries by specifying a search query.
